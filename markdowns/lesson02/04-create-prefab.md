# Creating a Prefab

## Creating the PickUp Prefab

Creating the prefab follows the standard Unity procedure: just drag the object from the _Hierarchy_ panel into the _Project_ one.

## Adding Prefab to the Scene

You can now create a set of coin prefabs in the scene: each one will have its own _Flowchart_ handling the pickup event.

In my case I have also put my coins inside a gameobject named _PickUps_.
