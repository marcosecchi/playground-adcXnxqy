# Setup

## Creating a new project

First of all, you'll need to create a new Unity Project (in my case, I named it  _Fungus3D_).

## Importing Assets

### Importing the Standard Assets

From the menu _Assets > Import Package_, import the following packages:

* **Cameras**
* **Characters**
* **Prototyping**

Note that some additional packages will be added, for instance **Utility**.

### Importing Fungus

Open the _Asset Store_ (_Window > Asset Store_), search for Fungus and download it.

> You can also [download the plugin from the browser](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/34184/directpurchase?aid=1011lHJn) (Unity3D will be opened and the download process will start).

Import just _Fungus_ (not _Fungus Examples_).

You are now ready to create a scene prototype.
